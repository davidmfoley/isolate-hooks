# THIS PACKAGE HAS MOVED!

isolate-hooks and isolate-components have been merged into **isolate-react**

To migrate to `isolate-react`:

1. Install `isolate-react` using yarn or npm and remove `isolate-hooks`.
2. Update your imports as follows:

Replace this:

```javascript
import isolateHook from 'isolate-hooks'
```

With this:

```javascript
import { isolateHook } from 'isolate-react'
```

All functionality and APIs are unchanged, so the migration should be fairly painles
